Then in the context bar to the right, select the `Info` icon and copy the collection `ID`. Make sure you're getting the `ID` for the collection, and not this request.\n    \n2. **Update the request URL:** Update the `{{collection_uuid}}` in the request URL with the collection `ID` from the previous step, by updating the Postman collection variable.\n    \n3. **Get your Postman API key**: Select the collection in the left sidebar, and tab over to **Variables** to edit collection variables. You can already see one variable called `postman_api_key`. Get your [Postman API key](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys), and paste the value under `CURRENT VALUE` (and not `INITIAL VALUE`).> ⚠ DON'T LEAK YOUR SECRETS!  \n    It's very important to add sensitive values like an API key to the `CURRENT VALUE` (and not `INITIAL VALUE`) of your public workspace since initial values can be viewed publicly in a public workspace. Storing sensitive values only in `CURRENT VALUE` keeps your secrets private in a team or public workspace. If you accidentally show your API key, [revoke and regenerate your API key](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys).  \n    Once you save the changes, Postman can authorize your request as shown under the **Headers** tab of the request.\n4. **Validate your solution**: Hit **Send** and look under the **Tests** tab of the server response at the bottom to review your test results. ENSURE ALL TESTS PASS.\n    \n\nIf you have any failures, review the failed test results or ask for support in the [community forum](https://community.postman.com/c/training/38).
