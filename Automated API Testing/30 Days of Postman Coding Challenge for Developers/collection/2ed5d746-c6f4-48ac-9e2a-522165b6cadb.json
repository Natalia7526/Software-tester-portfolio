Try to only collect links that are displayed in the search results. And then store the array as a [collection variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#variable-scopes) called `links`.\n\n  Hit **Send** to ensure your collection variable contains an array of links. Then [persist the collection variable](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#sharing-and-persisting-data) so that the array is saved with the collection under `INITIAL VALUE` as well as `CURRENT VALUE`.\n1. **Add two tests**: Write a test to ensure a successful response status code from bing. Then write another test to validate the information being stored as a collection variable is formatted as an array. Send the request to make sure the tests pass appropriately, and save your changes. \n\nOnce you complete these steps, move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution.
