Check out the other [dynamic variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/variables-list/) you can use in Postman.Send the request. You may need to try a few times to get search results. Postman generates `{{\\$randomWord}}` at the time of execution, so you can see what Postman is sending by inspecting [the console](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/troubleshooting-api-requests/#debugging-and-logs), or looking at the [client code generation](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/code-generators/) in the context bar to the right.\n2. **Add another request**: Add a second request called `moments in time` with the following details:\n    - `GET` request method\n    - `http://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip` request URLUnder the **Tests** tab, add a script to run after the request to determine what day is two days from now using a [built-in library](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/postman-sandbox-api-reference/#using-external-libraries) called Moment.js. Log your answer to the console. So if you are working on a Monday, this is what you would see in the console:\n        \n        ```\n                    \"Wednesday\"\n        \n         ```\n        \n3. **Other external libraries**: In addition to the [built-in libraries available in the Postman sandbox](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/postman-sandbox-api-reference/#using-external-libraries), there are ways to use other external libraries. Libraries served via content delivery network (CDN) can be [stored as a variable](https://community.postman.com/t/adding-external-libraries-to-postman/1971/4) or [retrieved with an API call](https://community.postman.com/t/adding-external-libraries-to-postman/1971/7). Libraries served on your localhost, as a [local package](https://github.com/matt-ball/postman-external-require) or [via npm](https://gist.github.com/kevinswiber/d15fcd73440a5df7511150ed78843e16), can also be retrieved with an API call. If you're using the Postman visualizer, you can [add the external library URL](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/visualizer/#adding-styling-and-interaction-to-visualizations) to a tag in the template code.\n    \n\nThis challenge covered how you can use libraries in Postman. You can also use a variety of [Postman resources](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/resources-intro/) in your own development projects, including APIs and libraries.\n\nOnce you complete these steps, save your changes and move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution.
