This means that you can use Postman to send SOAP requests or GraphQL queries.\n\n1. **Import a GraphQL schema**: There's a few ways to form a GraphQL query in Postman, such as sending JSON in a `POST` request body or sending an `application/graphql` header. In this challenge, let's [create a GraphQL schema](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/graphql/graphql-http/#import-graphql-schemas) to enable autocompletion in the next step. Under the **APIs** tab on the left, save this example schema and name it `spotify`.\n    \n    ``` graphql\n      type Query {\n      # Just returns \"Hello world!\"\n      hi(message: String = \"Hi\"): String\n      queryArtists(byName: String = \"Red Hot Chili Peppers\"): [Artist]\n      }\n      type Artist {\n      name: String!\n      id: ID\n      image: String\n      albums(limit: Int = 10): [Album]\n      }\n      type Album {\n      name: String\n      id: ID\n      image: String\n      tracks: [Track]\n      }\n      type Track {\n      name: String!\n      artists: [Artist]\n      preview_url: String\n      id: ID\n      }\n    \n     ```\n    \n2. **Add a request**: Return to the collection folder `GraphQL` and create a request `graphQL` with the following details.\n    - `POST` method\n    - `https://joyce-spotify-graphql.herokuapp.com/graphql` request URL\n    - `GraphQL` request bodyUnder the **Body** tab, select your new GraphQL schema from the dropdown. Refresh by clicking on the adjacent icon.\n3. **Edit a query**: Copy and paste the following query under the `Body` tab, or type it in manually to see how Postman suggests autocomplete options from the data within your GraphQL schema. Then update the GraphQL variable to return information about a different artist. Make sure your query returns information successfully, and then save your changes.\n    \n\n``` graphql\nquery getByArtist($name: String!) {\n    queryArtists (byName: $name) {\n        name\n        image\n        albums {\n            name\n        }\n        name\n        image\n        albums {\n            name\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n ```\n\nThis query uses a GraphQL variable defined like this:\n\n``` graphql\n{\"name\": \"Britney Spears\"} \n\n ```\n\nOnce you complete these steps, move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution.
