That's a bit meta, but allows us to keep everything in one spot for this example. In the future, you will probably create, trigger, and run the webhook from separate entities.\n\n1. **Add a request to be run**: Add the following request called `echo` to the folder `Webhooks`.\n    - `POST` request method\n    - `https://postman-echo.com/post` request URLUnder the **Pre-request Script** tab, add this code to receive a future payload and store this information as a collection variable called `newPayload`.\n        \n        ```\n          let incomingPayload = JSON.parse(globals.previousRequest).data\n          pm.collectionVariables.set(\"newPayload\", incomingPayload.message)\n        \n         ```\n        \n        Under the **Body** tab, add `{{newPayload}}` as a raw JSON body to send to this endpoint.Under the **Tests** tab, add the following code.\n    - Add test to verify a successful `200` response\n    - Add `postman.setNextRequest(null)`, so that when you run the collection only the first request will execute\n    - Add `console.log('Echoing my payload: ', pm.response.json().data)` to log the payload to the console\n2. **Create a webhook**: If you haven't already, fork the [parent collection for the Postman API](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a) into your own workspace. Find a request to `Create Webhook` and duplicate it over as the second request in the folder `Webhooks`.\n    - Set up authorization of this request using any method you prefer.\n    - Set the variables for `workspaceId`, `webhookName`, and `collectionUid` using any method you prefer. Use the ID of your current public workspace. The name of the webhook should be `echo webhook`. Use the ID of this collection.Send the call to create the webhook, and make a note of the `webhookUrl` for the next step.\n3. **Trigger the webhook**: Add the following request called `Trigger Webhook` as the third request in the folder `Webhooks`.\n    - `POST` request method\n    - The request URL is the `webhookUrl` received in the previous step; paste that value into the URL field\n    - The request body will contain a payload with a property `message` for our first call to parse it properly, like this:\n        \n        ```\n            {\n            \"message\": \"yellow world\"\n            }\n        \n         ```\n        \n\nSend this call to trigger the webhook.\n\n4\\. **Verify webhook triggered**: Behind the scenes, this webhook functions like a monitor run. This means our console statements are logged in the monitor console. Select the **Monitors** tab on the left, and find the name of your webhook. Click on the last run, scroll down to see the results, and then tab over to **Console Log**. Make sure your console statement contains the payload you sent in the previous step.\n\nOnce you complete these steps, save your changes, and then move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution.
