Log this number to the console. Save this number as a collection variable called `talls`, and then [persist the data](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/#sharing-and-persisting-data) so that `INITIAL VALUE` and `CURRENT VALUE` are the same.Make sure the two requests are behaving as expected before moving on to the next step.\n3. **Set up Newman**: To run this collection from your command line, set up Newman on your local machine.\n    - Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) for Linux, Windows, or Mac OSX\n    - Install [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) from npm globally on your system using the following command\n        \n        ```\n        $ npm install -g newman\n        \n         ```\n        \n4. **Export a collection to run it**: You can run a collection using a path to the file or the [Postman API](https://learning.postman.com/docs/developer/intro-api/) to retrieve a collection. In this example, we will [export this collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-postman-data) `Day 13: Newman`. Run the collection.\n    \n    ```\n    $ newman run \"Day 13- Newman.postman_collection.json\"\n    \n     ```\n    \n    It is expected that a few tests fail in the second folder, but not in the first folder.\n5. **Run a folder**: Run the command again, this time adding the option `--folder [folderName]` to the end, to specify the first folder to run from the collection. Make sure you have no failed tests.\n    \n\nOnce you complete these steps, move on to the next folder in this collection to submit your solution, this time using Newman.

Hit **Send** and look under the Tests tab of the server response at the bottom to review your test results.\n1. **Validate your solution in Newman** (optional): Instead of running this request in Postman, you can use Newman to validate your solution from the command line. You may need to do some research on this one. There's many ways to handle sensitive information locally while running Newman, but be careful not to expose your secrets in your public workspace.\n\nIf you have any failures, review the failed test results or ask for support in the [community forum](https://community.postman.com/).
